## About the project
The business problem we chose to study is the prediction of restaurants ratings. Having notice that reviews being often biased, we wanted to adress a data mining and machine learning problem to analyse the impact of the different variables on restaurant ratings. Our aim is to study the potential correlations of features for a restaurant's rating and the comparison of different techniques.
## Structure Project


### /code
Contains the different codes necessary for the realization of this project, namely:

***Data Pre-processing.ipynb*** : contains the extraction of the attributes of business out of raw data and converts them into readable data format 

***DataCleaning.ipynb***: contains the cleaning version of the datasets. extract features

***EDA.ipynb***: contains the exploration data analysis

***Main.ipynb***: contains the main Notebook.


### /data
The folder contains the original versions of datasets as well as the cleaned version. The raw dataset includes information about local businesses in 10 metropolitan areas across 2 countries.
You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)

Here is a short explanation of the main features of this dataset :
* *is_open* - binary showing, whether a restaurant is permanently closed
* *latitude* - geographical location (latitude) of the restaurant
* *longitude* - geographical location (longitude) of the restaurant
* *name_length* - length of the name of the restaurant
* *Price* - price category(1 - least expensive, 4 - most expensive)
* *Anymusic* - if music is available in the restaurant (DJ, live, etc.)
* *review_count* - number of reviews on YELP for a restaurant
* *Cuisines* - many TRUE/FALSE features for cuisine types
* *stars* - dependent variable (star rating of the restaurant from 1 to 5)
### /document
